## Purpose

The ROMS directory contains zipped file of the particular cards I have been working with.
EthOS directory contains the local.conf and watchdog script I had been using.
UbuntuMiner serves not only for archiving but also for documentation considering there is not
much on the subject about using both AMD and Nvidia on the same rig
